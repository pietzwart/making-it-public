<p>This ebook is the outcome of a three day thematic project that took place at the Piet Zwart Institute in November of 2015. While the subjects addressed during the thematic will be discussed in the following chapters, this foreword exists as a trace of how this ebook, which you have downloaded, came to be.</p>
<p>A recurring project in the first year at the PZI is a documentation project that asks first year students to produce documents that back up second year students thesis projects. Our group, the class of 2015, were alternately assigned a meta task; not to document the work of previous students, but to deal with the existing archive that this exercise has produced, over it's 4 years of application.</p>
<p>The tutors, Annet Dekker and André Castro, titled the session Making it Public, voicing an additional constraint to the project: making the archive accessible. This context punctuated a fair portion of the discussions and work during our work sessions. An added element of the project, was an attitude towards the portability (or the encapsulation) of the archive we were making. Practically speaking, this means that we were introduced to the epub format as a way of gathering, organising, and distributing the archive. Not only this, but the format seems to allow for most of the things we would want out of the collection: exploration, indexing, hypertext and (in most cases, device dependent) playable media.</p>
<p>After spending some time with the production material built up over the previous years, we came to understand that while within the context of each individual project, and it's document—arian counterpart, we could discern the majority of what the project was about. But take the documentation away from the project it speaks of, the result is confusion, or more appropriately, distortion.</p>
<p>There we were, standing an extra step away from the original graduation projects. Documenting the documentation, for all it's worth. Attempting to give an honest overview, from the inside, acknowledging the process of documentation creation rather that classically ordering and archiving the content we had been presented with. Further details of these distortions (new and old) can be found in the texts that follow, supplying an account of the goings on of the project itself.</p>
