# INC Hybrid Publication's Resources

This repository consists of a collection of resources aimed at the development hybrid publications, in both reflowable format (EPUB3) and *fixed layout* (Scribus and inDesign structured content).
The resources propose a workflow based on the conversion between markup languages, using [Pandoc]() and [Markdown]() source-files as its essential elements.
Most of the ideas materialized in this collections of resources originated from the research developed by the [Digital Publishing Toolkit]() project, specially the controbutions from [Michael Murtaugh]() and [Silvio Lorusso]().

# TODO
* in `git clone` make depth 1 - no previous history
* rm -tf .git

* font in epub/ ; rm lib/

* integrate `epub_zip.py` and `epub_unzip.py` with `epub_process.py` so that latter does only processing

# Notes from workshop

html5lib missing from macs - fix in epub_process.py

clean up markdown: use pandoc -f markdown -t markdown (see book)
