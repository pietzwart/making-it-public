<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The thematic workshop looked at modes of public distribution and the difficulties faced in shifting private sources of knowledge into the public terrain.The prospect of knowledge sharing within the public sphere presents the idealistic model of free education, open culture and equality of opinions.The term “private” entails the right to express one’s subjective opinion and upholds the validity of one’s own voice and interpretation. As a consequence of the attempt to move the “private” into the public sphere, the original intention becomes impinged through the process of distribution. The nature of publicising content involves acts of distortion, corruption of intent, curatorial and editorial censorship and filtration. In order to present a coherent order of discourse from the multiplicity of sources to promote apparent “objectivity”, it becomes necessary to undergo selection, exclusion and inclusion.</p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>
Based upon the above stated texts, we devised a game that we felt was representative of the readings.<br/><br/>

We selected three objects to present to the class, each of which was meant as a representative of a larger ideology an Aloe Vera Plant (ecology/health) A Statuette with a plastic (culture) Bananas in a plastic bag (consumerism/property) The class was then asked to each select one object they felt somehow attached to and form groups around each. The groups were then instructed to discuss their shared appreciation of the objects - this instruction was given in hope of creating a sense of community. The groups were also asked to select a leader from the group as a public representative. Once these communities were formed, and leaders selected, we informed the class that one of the three objects had to be destroyed. The group leaders were given the responsibility to step forward and defend the preservation of their objects. After each leader presented a defence for their object to the class, the class was asked to vote on which object was to be destroyed. One object was destroyed With two objects remaining, we repeated the experiment and asked the class to yet again cast a vote for which object should be destroyed and which preserved. Ultimately the majority vote ruled for one object to remain, all others were destroyed.<br/><br/>

Our intention for this assignment was to inspire the individuals of our class to form "communities", within the "society" which we existed in as a class. These communities would then naturally form into a "mainstream" majority as well as a diversity of "subcultures". These separate communities were then asked to cast a vote which would decide upon which communities "ideals" would survive, in order to illustrate various democratic models.<br/><br/>

Our expectations of the experiment were that the majority of the group would opt to be a part of the "BANANA COMMUNITY" This did occur although when asked upon a second vote, we found that a large section of the majority joined a "subculture" There are various possible explanations for this: 1. Persuasive campaigning 2. The individual's of the class are naturally inclined to make part of subcultures. Even in this experiment, having found themselves within the Mainstream, they ultimately opted for a subculture.<br/><br/>

The minority group convinced other groups to join them. The convincing part is similar to media publishing and it was persuasive.<br/><br/>

The culture being preserved is the propaganda's choice....</p>

<h4>Making it public for who? – Aymeric</h4>
<p>Beginning with a short summary of the historical evolution of Free Software and Free Culture, Aymeric questioned the blurring borders of private and public concepts both in socio-political and digital space. Between the years '99-'03 (the good years) digital intellectual property could be released under various branches of licence, which offered legal variations on release and authorship rights. Richard Stallman developed the concept of the General Public Licence, which was intended as a common space for collaboration, to share knowledge and exchange ideas through the WorldWideWeb. The GPL was later divided into two fractions; Free Software and Open Source Software, the two segments standing in opposition to the dominant ideology of Neo-Liberal Privatisation. These two communities, albeit sharing a similar approach, were unable to come to a consensus on a legal model for sharing and releasing intellectual property, as their ideologies strongly differed.

Eric Raymond, advocating the OSS ideology, focusses primarily on economic Interest. This argument supports the concept of Open Source Software as far as its potential to improve products. Richard Stallman, stands in opposition as a 'software freedom activist', envisioned an ethical model, which would respect the users' freedom and community. Allowing them the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

The two segments became increasingly fragmented as they came into the era of pluralism, in which multiple modes of licensing were made available to users, seemingly tailored to the individual's needs. These were made available through the competitive climate created by the two parallel communities, both of which adhering to their own differing agendas. Agonistic model: competing, opening everything under differing licence - power struggle, more choice for users. The golden era of pluralism ended somewhere in 2003. Due to ideological and economic bankruptcy, the various licensing models withdrew and formed into two dominant blocks: CC and Free Culture. As the Free Culture movement is driven by ethical
