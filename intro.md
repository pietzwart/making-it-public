# foreword
This is the result and outcome of a three day thematic project that took place at the Piet Zwart Institute in November of 2015.

While the subjects addressed during the thematic will be discussed further in the book, this foreword exists to give a trace of how this specific object that you have downloaded came to be.

A recurring project in the first year at PZI is a documentation project that asks first year students to produce documents that back up second year students thesis projects. The questions that ensue were the focus of the previous years, but for us, the class of 2015, we've been assigned a meta task; not to work on other student's work, but to deal with the archive that this exercise has produced, over it's 4 years of application.

The tutors, [Annet Dekker](http://aaaan.net/) and [Andr√© Castro](http://pinknoi.so/), named the session *Making it Public*, voicing an additionnal constraint to the project: giving access to the archive. This rhythmed a fair portion of the discussions and work during the worksessions. An added element of the project, was an attitude towards the portability (or the encapsulation) of the archive we were making. Practically speaking, this means that we were introduced to the epub format as a way of gathering, organising, and distributing the archive. Not only this, but the format seems to allow for most of the things we would want out of the collection: exploration, indexing, hypertext and (in many cases) playable media.

After spending some time with the production material built up over the previous years, we came to understand that while within the context of each individual project, and it's document(arian) counterpart, we could discern the majority of what the project was about. But take the documentation away from the project it speaks of, the result is confusion, or more precisely, distortion.

Now here *we* were, having to look at
