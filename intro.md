# foreword
This is the result and outcome of a three day thematic project that took place at the Piet Zwart Institute in November of 2015.

While the subjects addressed during the thematic will be discussed further in the book, this foreword exists to give a trace of how this specific object that you have downloaded came to be.

A recurring project in the first year at PZI is a documentation project that requires first year students to produce documents that back up second year students thesis projects. The questions that ensue were the focus of the previous years, but for us, the class of 2015, we've been assigned a meta task; not to work on other student's work, but to deal with the archive that this exercise has produced, over it's 4 years of application.

The tutors, [Annet Dekker](http://aaaan.net/) and [Andr√© Castro](http://pinknoi.so/), named the session *Making it Public*, voicing an added constraint to the project: giving access to the archive.
